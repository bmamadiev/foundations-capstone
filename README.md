# Kenzie Java Project - Capstone

Created an app that uses the jService API to create a trivia quiz with 10 questions where a user will be shown questions that they can respond to. If the user answers correctly, the total score will update by one point. If the user answers incorrectly, the total score does not update.

To complete the project, I implemented the following tasks:

• Used HTTP GET to pull questions and categories from the API;
• Created a command-line interface that accepts and checks a user's input;
• Mapped JSON data to a data transfer object;
• Wrote a code that is organized, easily understood, and free of errors.
